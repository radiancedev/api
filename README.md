## Overview

This is the source code to the [Radiance](https://radiance.moe) backend API, and is practically where everything happens. This is the code that handles all the requests, and is the code that is responsible for the majority of the functionality of the site. Publicly, this codebase exists solely as a place for contributors to be able to work on as well as general website transparency, but it by no means meant for public use. You are allowed to use this code within the bounds of this license to reasonably work on it, but redistribution is prohibited for the purposes of copying the website. You are also not allowed to use any assets that belong to Radiance.moe, including but not limited to the logo, favicon, and any other images or assets that are not explicitly licensed for public use.

## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.x or higher)
* TypeScript (v5.x or higher)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (v13.x or higher)
